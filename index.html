    <p>
      I am a Post Processor Developer as BobCAD-CAM.
      BobCAD-CAM is a CAD-CAM software that was created in 1985. The software
      supports Milling machines (2.5 up to 5 axis), Lathes, Mill-Turn, Wire EDM,
      Laser, Plasma and Waterjet. CAD-CAM software is used in the manufacturing
      industry to create programs that post out G and M codes to get sent and
      run on those machines. This process is called, "CNC" or Computer Numeric
      Control and is used for precision machining where the tolerance of the
      parts that get produced can be anywhere from +/- 0.005" (in industry
      terms: plus or minus 5 "thou") for Milling machines and +/- 0.0001" (One
      tenth of a "thou") for Wire EDM machines. To put into perspective, the
      thickness of a human hair is around 0.002" or 2 "thou".

    <p>
      A post processor is an ASCII text file that is used to convert the
      internal machine code (CLF File) that the CAD-CAM software creates into a format that
      the machine can understand. For BobCAD-CAM software, we have our own format for post processors
      that uses something called, "Post Blocks" where post variables and strings are set. Some examples 
      of post blocks would be the File Header block where you set g and m codes that are used at the 
      begginnig of the file. Another example would be a Tool Change post block where you can define
      what g and m codes get used during tool changes at the CNC machine. There are also program blocks 
      that use the "VBScript" and "Lua" languages for more control over the output. The post processor is the most 
      important part of the software because it is the last step before the code gets sent to
      the machine. If the post processor is not correct, the machine will not
      run the program correctly and the part will not be made correctly. My job
      is to create and maintain these post processors for the machines that we
      support. I also create and maintain post processor utilities such as the BobCAD-CAM Post Processor Utility
      for Visual Studio Code that use Javascript and other internal post processor utilites that use C#.
